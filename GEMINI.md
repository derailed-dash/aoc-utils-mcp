# Advent-of-Code (AoC) Utils

## Aoc-Utils MCP Server 

The `aoc-utils-mcp` provides utilities for working with Advent of Code.

- The `get_puzzle_input(year: int, day: int)` retrieves your puzzle data for a given specific year and day.

## General Instructions

- When you are asked to provide the puzzle data for a given day:
  1. You should do so and then present to the user in human-readable format, i.e. with any line break characters stripped out.
  2. Offer to save the input file in a `tmp` location in the current workspace.
  3. Do NOT perform any additional steps without first being asked to. For example, do not try and solve the puzzle.
